      <p class="text-gray-500">Our pendants are unique to the market, offering bespoke options and high-quality craftsmanship. Our lighting range is designed to suit both residential and commercial projects and can be customised to complement many interior styles and budgets.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-6 xl:mt-0">Our design office and dedicated electrical workshop are located in Currumbin, Queensland. It is important to us to support other Australian businesses, so we have partnered with a select group of makers across Queensland and New South Wales who support us in crafting the timber for our pendants and creating our custom finishings. We are a registered Australian Made Campaign business.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-500 mt-4">Our products are sustainably crafted to be enduring and of the highest quality. The use of solid timber is no coincidence, our team of experienced makers have been working with timber for over 35 years. We are proud of our collaboration with Currumbin Woodworks, founded and run by Shariâ€™s dad, Chris (top left above). Chris and Shari developed the original Fluxwood range of pendants together and now the team at Currumbin Woodworks craft our Tenn and Hollow Pendants, and complete all of our timber crafting and finishing work at their timber workshop in Currumbin. Timi (top right above) is on the workshop team and manages the Fluxwood timber production at Currumbin Woodworks.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 mt-6">With a deep understanding of the material, our team handcraft contemporary and high quality pendants from solid timber. Driven by a love for the craft, our makers create unique lighting which showcases the natural variations of Australian hardwood timbers.</p>
